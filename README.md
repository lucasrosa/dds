### Logic

#### Cleanup
- Remove tld
- Convert to lowercase
- Convert from punycode

#### Detection
- Consider natural language matching (bah√≠a == bahia)
- Contains numbers
- Contains company/brand name
- Contains suspiscious word (christmas, world cup)
- Is similar to existing phishing
- Contains prefix/suffix (login, signin, verify...)
